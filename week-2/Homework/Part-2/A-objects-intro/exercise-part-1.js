/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

let mobile ={
    brand: iphone
};

let house = {
rooms:3
};

let skates = {
    brand:RollerBlade
}

let language ={
    writeLevel: "higth",
   
};

let school = {
    classes: 9
}
